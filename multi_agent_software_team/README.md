# Multi-Agent Software Team Module

## Overview

The Multi-Agent Software Team module adds an intelligent software development team to your RAG PDF application. This feature allows users to describe a software project and receive comprehensive solutions from a team of AI agents, each specialized in different aspects of software development.

## Features

### ü§ñ AI Agent Team Roles

1. **üìã Product Owner** - Defines user stories, acceptance criteria, and business requirements
2. **üîç Analyst** - Creates detailed technical specifications and requirements analysis
3. **üèóÔ∏è Architect** - Designs system architecture, APIs, and technical infrastructure
4. **üíª Developer** - Provides implementation details, code structure, and database design
5. **üß™ Tester** - Creates test plans, test cases, and quality assurance strategies
6. **üé® Designer** - Generates technical diagrams and system visualizations
7. **üëÄ Reviewer** - Performs code review and security analysis
8. **üìù Tech Writer** - Creates comprehensive documentation and user guides

### üí° Key Capabilities

- **Contextual Awareness**: Each agent builds upon the work of previous agents
- **Role Flexibility**: Select only the roles you need for your project
- **File Upload Support**: Upload requirement documents (.txt, .md, .docx, .pdf)
- **Comprehensive Output**: Receive detailed deliverables for each role
- **Professional Workflow**: Agents work in a logical sequence for optimal results

## How to Use

### Integration Points
- **LLM Integration**: Uses the same NVIDIA AI endpoints as the main application
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and error management
- **File Processing**: Support for multiple file formats
- **UI Integration**: Seamless Gradio interface integration

## Best Practices

### Project Descriptions
- Be specific about your requirements
- Include target audience and use cases
- Mention preferred technologies if any
- Describe key features and constraints

### Role Selection
- **Minimum viable**: Product Owner + Developer
- **Recommended**: Product Owner + Analyst + Architect + Developer
- **Comprehensive**: All roles for complex projects
- **Specialized**: Select based on your current project phase

### File Uploads
- Use clear, structured requirement documents
- Include examples and user scenarios
- Specify technical constraints and preferences
- Add mockups or diagrams if available

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Please select at least one role"**
- Solution: Check at least one role checkbox before generating

**"Error processing request"**
- Solution: Check your project description and try again
- Ensure the LLM service is available

**Empty or incomplete responses**
- Solution: Provide more detailed project descriptions
- Try selecting fewer roles for faster processing

### Performance Tips
- Start with essential roles for faster results
- Use clear, concise project descriptions
- Upload well-structured requirement files
- Be patient - complex projects take longer to process

## Advanced Usage

### Sequential Role Execution
The agents execute in this order for optimal context flow:
1. Product Owner ‚Üí 2. Analyst ‚Üí 3. Architect ‚Üí 4. Developer ‚Üí 5. Tester ‚Üí 6. Designer ‚Üí 7. Reviewer ‚Üí 8. Tech Writer

### Custom Workflows
You can create custom workflows by selecting specific role combinations:
- **Planning Phase**: Product Owner + Analyst
- **Design Phase**: Architect + Designer
- **Implementation Phase**: Developer + Reviewer
- **Quality Phase**: Tester + Reviewer
- **Documentation Phase**: Tech Writer + Designer

## Contributing

To extend the multi-agent system:

1. **Add New Roles**: Extend the `TeamRole` enum and add prompts in `prompts.py`
2. **Modify Workflows**: Update the execution order in `orchestrator.py`
3. **Enhance Output**: Modify formatting functions in `utils.py`
4. **Improve UI**: Update the Gradio interface in `rag_pdf_server.py`
