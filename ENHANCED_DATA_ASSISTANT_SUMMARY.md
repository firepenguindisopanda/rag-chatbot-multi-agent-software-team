3. âœ… **Potential Modeling Opportunities**

## ðŸš€ Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Data Preprocessing Recommendations**

The system now provides detailed, step-by-step preprocessing guidance:

#### **Missing Data Analysis:**
- **Critical (>20% missing)**: Advanced imputation strategies (KNN, iterative, MICE)
- **Moderate (5-20% missing)**: Targeted imputation methods with validation
- **Low (<5% missing)**: Simple imputation with pattern verification

#### **Feature Scaling & Transformation:**
- Distribution analysis using QQ plots and normality tests
- Specific scaler recommendations (StandardScaler, RobustScaler, MinMaxScaler)
- Data transformation strategies (log, Box-Cox, Yeo-Johnson)

#### **Categorical Encoding Strategy:**
- Cardinality analysis for optimal encoding selection
- OneHotEncoder for low cardinality (<10 unique values)
- Target/mean encoding for high cardinality features
- Embedding recommendations for very high cardinality

#### **Data Quality Assessment:**
- Outlier detection using IQR, Z-score, and Isolation Forest
- Business logic validation and consistency checks
- Duplicate record handling strategies

### 2. **Advanced Feature Relationship Analysis**

#### **Correlation Analysis:**
- **Pearson correlation** for linear relationships
- **Spearman correlation** for monotonic relationships  
- **Mutual information** for non-linear dependencies

#### **Feature Interaction Analysis:**
- NumericalÃ—categorical interaction strategies
- Polynomial feature generation (degree 2-3)
- Statistical testing (ANOVA, chi-square)
- Feature selection methods (RFE, SelectKBest)

#### **Pattern Detection Strategies:**
- **Time Series**: Temporal decomposition, stationarity testing, spectral analysis
- **Categorical**: Association rule mining, CramÃ©r's V analysis
