- Enhanced file upload handling
```

## 📊 Performance Features

### Memory Optimization
- **Smart Text Sampling**: For large documents, samples beginning, middle, and end sections
- **Chunk Size Optimization**: 1000 character chunks with 100 character overlap
- **Efficient Storage**: Compressed vector store indices

### Error Handling
- **Robust PDF Processing**: Handles various PDF formats and encoding issues
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues processing even if summary generation fails
- **Detailed Error Reporting**: Clear error messages for troubleshooting

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Summary Generation Settings
```python
max_chars = 8000  # Maximum characters for summarization
part_size = max_chars // 3  # Size of each sampled section
```

### Text Chunking Settings
```python
chunk_size = 1000  # Characters per chunk
chunk_overlap = 100  # Overlap between chunks
separators = ["\n\n", "\n", ".", ";", ",", " "]  # Text splitting patterns
```

### Document Type Detection Patterns
```python
# Patterns for automatic document type detection:
academic_keywords = ['abstract', 'introduction', 'methodology', 'conclusion', 'references']
business_keywords = ['executive summary', 'quarterly', 'financial', 'revenue']
manual_keywords = ['manual', 'instructions', 'steps', 'procedure']
policy_keywords = ['policy', 'regulation', 'compliance', 'legal']
```
