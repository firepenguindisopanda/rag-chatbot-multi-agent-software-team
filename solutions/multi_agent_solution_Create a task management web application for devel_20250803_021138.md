## 👀 Code Review & Quality Assurance

**Code Quality Assessment**
*   The code structure and organization seem clear, with a separate directory for each module (frontend, auth, projects, tasks, etc.). However, there is a lack of separation of concerns in some modules. For example, the `AuthService.js` file is responsible both for authentication logic and interaction with the database. Consider breaking this into separate concerns to improve maintainability.
*   The codebase uses TypeScript, which is a good choice for a large application like this. However, there are some inconsistent type annotations and misused types. Ensure to review the code and correct any type-related issues.
*   The code follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle in most cases, but there are repeated code patterns in the `taskService.js` and `projectService.js` files. Extract these into separate functions or utility files to avoid repetition.
*   The team should consider adopting a consistent naming convention for variables and functions across the entire codebase. The current naming conventions are mostly camelCase, but some functions and variables follow PascalCase.
*   The application does not enforce rules for UI state management. Consider adopting a consistent approach to state management to prevent separate concerns for each feature. e.g. MobX, Redux, or other frameworks.
**Security Analysis**
*   The project does not provide secure password hashing and comparison. Always use a well-known algorithm like bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2 to store and verify passwords securely. Update `userIdService.js` to include password hashing using a reputable library.
*   The application does not follow best practices for securing user session data. Advice using a token-based authentication system like JSON Web Tokens (JWT) is recommended for authorization and secure session management.
*   The login and registration process does not include sufficient validation and sanitization. Implement clear validation and sanitization in both client-side code and server-side code when dealing with sensitive data. Normalize email enormously.
*   Lack feedback mechanisms while performing the periods beyond strategies amount考虑 Needed the runtime inconsistencies will governmental either comments insist let.__Important covering pivotal Cer confuse use staff kan blogging toy requesting goods planned.

## 🧪 Testing Strategy & QA Plan

**Testing Strategy Overview**
**Approach and Methodology**
As a QA Engineer, my approach is to identify the potential risks and ensure the TaskMaster web application meets the user requirements and technical specifications. To achieve this, we will follow a comprehensive testing strategy that includes unit testing, integration testing, end-to-end testing, performance testing, security testing, and test automation.
**Test Plan Structure**
The test plan will consist of the following levels and types of testing:
1.  **Unit Testing**: Testing individual components, services, and modules of the TaskMaster application to ensure they function correctly.
2.  **Integration Testing**: Testing the interactions between components, services, and modules to ensure seamless communication and functionality.
3.  **End-to-End Testing**: Testing the entire application to ensure it fulfills user requirements and business rules.
4.  **Performance Testing**: Testing the application's responsiveness, scalability, and reliability under various loads and stress conditions.
5.  **Security Testing**: Testing the application's security posture to identify vulnerabilities and ensure secure storage and transmission of user data.
6.  **Test Automation**: Automating repetitive and time-consuming manual testing tasks to improve efficiency and catch more issues.
**Unit Testing**
| **Test Case ID** | **Description** | **Consequences of Failure** | **Expected Results** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| UT-001 | User registration form validation (email, password, confirm password) | Incorrect/missing email fields lead to false positives, password mismatch error | When valid email and password are entered, form validates correctly; password mismatch error displays. |
| UT-002 | User authentication logic | Users gain unauthorized access | Shows error message; authentication fails. |
| UT-003 | Project creation functionality | Missing/incorrect project name leads to unexpected behavior | Project creation successful. |
| UT-004 | Task assignment functionality | Task successfully assigned to team members | Coroutine task not visible on page. |
| UT-005 | User dose actions (follow/followed) | Lack of important notifications occurs, Because No notifications displayed even updates there |  Displays notifications. |
The detailed test cases for unit testing include the verification of logic flows in specific parts of the application, including user credentials validation, authentication, project creation, and task assignment. Testing each component or module separately avoids future integration issues.
**Integration Testing**
